## **11. Miscellaneous Metrics**

Other metrics that don't fit neatly into the above categories.

### **11.1 Perplexity**

- **Definition:** Measures how well a probability model predicts a sample.
- **Intuitive Explanation:** A lower perplexity indicates the model is less "surprised" by the data, meaning it predicts the sample well.
- **Examples:**
  - **Example 1:** Language model has lower perplexity on in-domain text.
  - **Example 2:** Higher perplexity indicates poor prediction on out-of-domain data.
  - **Example 3:** Comparing perplexity before and after fine-tuning a model to assess improvement.
- **Range:** Positive real numbers. Lower is better.
- **Use Cases:** Language modeling.
- **When to Use:** Evaluating probabilistic models.
- **Ease of Use:** **Easy.** Calculated from model outputs.
- **Common Usage in Papers:** Standard in language model evaluations.

### **11.2 Edit Distance Metrics**

- **Definition:** Calculates the minimum number of edits needed to change one text into another.
- **Intuitive Explanation:** Measures text similarity at the character or word level, like counting how many steps it takes to correct a misspelled word.
- **Examples:**
  - **Example 1:** Spelling correction from "accomodate" to "accommodate" requires one insertion (edit distance = 1).
  - **Example 2:** DNA sequence alignment to find mutations.
  - **Example 3:** Comparing "kitten" to "sitting" has an edit distance of 3.
- **Range:** 0 to length of the text. Lower is better.
- **Use Cases:** Spelling correction, text similarity.
- **When to Use:** When precise differences matter.
- **Ease of Use:** **Easy.** Algorithms like Levenshtein distance are standard.
- **Common Usage in Papers:** Used in OCR and error correction research.

### **11.3 Word Error Rate (WER)**

- **Definition:** Measures the rate of errors in transcribed speech compared to the reference.
- **Intuitive Explanation:** Calculates how many words need to be changed to match the reference, relative to the total number of words.
- **Examples:**
  - **Example 1:** Speech recognition system transcribes "I love cats" as "I love hats" (WER = 33%).
  - **Example 2:** System misses words or adds extra words, increasing WER.
  - **Example 3:** Comparing different models to find the one with the lowest WER.
- **Range:** 0 to 1. Lower is better.
- **Use Cases:** Speech recognition.
- **When to Use:** Evaluating transcription accuracy.
- **Ease of Use:** **Easy.** Based on substitutions, insertions, deletions.
- **Common Usage in Papers:** Standard in speech recognition research.

### **11.4 Calibration Metrics**

- **Definition:** Assesses whether predicted probabilities reflect true likelihoods.
- **Intuitive Explanation:** Checks if the model's confidence matches reality, ensuring reliable probability estimates.
